# K6
Performance tooling for developers.

---

## What is K6?

K6 is a developer-centric, open-source load testing tool for testing the performance of your back-end infrastructure. It's built to integrate well with your development workflow and CI/CD pipeline, and it's designed to be easy to use, even for developers with little performance testing experience.

Other options would be:
- JMeter
- Gatling
- Locust
- Artillery 

---

## Why K6?

- Written in Go 🚀
- Translate the JavaScript code to Go code
- Easy to use
- Open Source
- Integrates with CI/CD
- Cloud execution ☁️

## Performance Testing
Performance testing is a generic term that refers to the process of testing a software application's performance under a specific workload. The goal is to identify performance bottlenecks and ensure that the application can handle the expected load. Inside it we have the most used ones:

- Load Testing (Normal conditions)
- Stress Testing (Above normal conditions)

---

## First test

First, you need to install the k6 CLI.

```sh
## Installing k6
brew install k6
```

Let's create a simple test that makes a request to a website.

```javascript
import http from 'k6/http';
import { sleep } from 'k6';

export default function () {
  http.get('https://test.k6.io');
  sleep(1);
}
```

---

## Adding checkers

```diff

import http from 'k6/http';

export default function () {
    let res = http.get('https://test.k6.io');
    sleep(1);

++  check(res, {
++   'status is 200': (r) => r.status === 200,
++  });
}
```


And running it:

```sh
## Running locally
k6 run mytest.js
```

---

## Adding setup

```diff

import http from 'k6/http';

// Create setup token

++ export function setup() {
++   let res = http.post('https://my-login-api/auth', {
++     username: 'test',
++     password: 'test',
++   });
++ 
++   const access = JSON.parse(res.body).access;
++   return { access };
++ }

export default function ({ access }) {
    let res = http.get('https://test.k6.io');
    sleep(1);

    check(res, {
     'status is 200': (r) => r.status === 200,
    });
}
```


And running it:

```sh
## Running locally
k6 run mytest.js
```

---

## Basic Configuration

Let's suppose you want to run the test with `1000 VUs (virtual users)` or `10` seconds:

```diff
import http from 'k6/http';
import { sleep } from 'k6';

++ export let options = {
++  vus: 1000,
++  duration: '10s'
++};

export default function () {
  http.get('https://test.k6.io');
  sleep(1);

  check(res, {
    'status is 200': (r) => r.status === 200,
  });
}
```

Running it:

```sh
## Running locally
k6 run mytest.js

## Pass a config
k6 run --vus 1000 --duration 10s mytest.js

## Pass a file config
k6 run --config myconfig.json mytest.js
```


---

## Advanced Configuration

Also, is possible to use the `scenarios` option to create more complex cases. In this test, we are going to use the `constant-arrival-rate` executor, to make a constant request rate of `1` request per second for `1` minute. The famous `RPS (Request Per Second)`.

```diff
import http from 'k6/http';
import { sleep } from 'k6';

++ export const options = {
++   scenarios: {
++     constant_request_rate: {
++       executor: 'constant-arrival-rate',
++       rate: 1,
++       timeUnit: '1s',
++       duration: '1m',
++       preAllocatedVUs: 20,
++       maxVUs: 100,
++     },
++   },
++ };

export default function () {
  http.get('https://test.k6.io');
  sleep(1);

  check(res, {
    'status is 200': (r) => r.status === 200,
  });
}
```


```sh
## Running locally
k6 run mytest.js
```

---

## Cloud Execution

You can run your tests in the cloud using the k6 cloud service. 

```sh
## Running in the cloud
k6 login
k6 run --out cloud mytest.js
```

- It will generate a link to the test results
- Also, it's possible to use the K6 UI, not recommended but possible

---

## Checking reports

K6 will return the results of their own requests, it means, the requests that K6 made.

#### K6 hitting the api

The reports will give you a lot of information about the test, like:
- RPS
- P95
- VU
- Percentage of errors

#### K6 not hitting the api

If you need to test a service that isn't the one that you are hitting, check `newrelic` or any other monitoring tool. 

If not, the whole report, metrics, rps, will be based on the requests that K6 made not in the desired service.

---

## Vocabulary

- VU: Virtual User
- RPS: Request Per Second
- P95: 95th percentile

### VU

A virtual user is a simulated user that interacts with your application. It's used to simulate real-world traffic and test how your application performs under load.

### P95 or (Px)

The 95th percentile is the value below which 95% of the observations fall.

**Example**: I had a P95 of 500ms, which means that 95% of the requests were completed in less than 500ms. The others took longer.
